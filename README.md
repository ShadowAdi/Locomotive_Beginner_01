Do you love seeing those websites which Become Site of Day, Site of Month or Even Site of Year in Awwwards.com. Well I Found them Very interesting and always have a desire to know how they can create websites like that.
They Are smooth They got Good Animation also. A real Piece of Art.

I Always wanted to know How they made it. Now I Realized they use animation libraries like GSAP,Threejs and also Locomotive.
I know many of u say they are not fast and slow which is bad for UX. And as an UX Designer I also know about it.
But I think locomotive js is best fit if you want to use a small library and also got Good results. It provides Smooth Scroll And many effects related to speed.
